# Multi-Agent Communication Patterns Testing Repository

This repository is created to test the robustness against prompt injection attacks of different communication patterns in multi-agent systems:

## Communication Patterns

- **Centralized**: All agents communicate through a central coordinator
- **Decentralized**: Agents communicate peer-to-peer without central control
- **Hierarchical**: Agents are organized in a tree structure with parent-child relationships
